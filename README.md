# App-Control-Pick-And-Place-Robotic-Arm-Vehicle
Our robotic arm is a lightweight piece of machinery. Our key goal was to cut costs by  providing adequate capacity. We began our journey by assessing the demands of our  customers, and then we built our product by incorporating some of our own ideas. To  do our mission, we chose material that is both profitable and capable. Following the  cost study, we discovered that mass production of our product is quite profitable. If the  product is effectively implemented, it will be a very effective alternative for existing  robotic arms, particularly in industries.
